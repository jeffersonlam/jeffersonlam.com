## Dev
This is a static website that uses `gulp` to compile scss.
Run `gulp` to watch for changes and compile into `dist/` folder.

## Deploy
Connect to the hosting server with your of choice (SSH, FTP, FileZilla, OSX Finder Connect to Server, etc) and upload the changed files.

Deploy previously used git ftp (see readme history) but it's no longer for some mysterious reason.
