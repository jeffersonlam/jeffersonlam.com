            <p>Playing with Google streetview, I thought to myself, "I wish there was an easier way to see the streetviews down a route." Soon enough, I made an app where you could scroll through Google streetview. After posting it on <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('reddit'); return false;"href="https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1yia5s/my_first_webapp_ever_presenting_you_google_maps/">reddit</a>, it quickly reached 10k unique visitors and 50k API calls in its first week. This was my first app, built during my time at <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('coding dojo'); return false;"href="https://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a> with plain HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery. 2014.</p>

            <p>I took on the challenge of creating a mock redesign of United Airline's mobile app. This is a clickable coded prototype of a design concept. 2014.</p>

              <p>As part of a 3-person team, we created a game to make learning geography a fun social experience, especially for K-12 education. This was a unique challenge of designing and developing on multiple fronts. We had multiple users – students and teachers – as well as experiences to design and build – game design, the in-game experience, and the "out-game" experience. <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('streetspin facebook video'); return false;"href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/StreetSpinGame/videos/?ref=page_internal">See it played</a>. 2016 to 2017.</p>

              Is It Whole30?
            </a>
            <p>While doing my first Whole30, I often found myself googling additives in grocery store aisles. Frustrated by this tedious and repetitive task, I compiled all the info I could find into a CSV file, converted it into a JSON object (I built a <a target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://jefferson.im/csvtojson/'); return false;"href="http://jefferson.im/csvtojson/">separate tool for that</a>), and wrapped it with a UI built in React to make it immediately searchable. 2018.</p>

            <div>IBM Community Radio</div>
            <p>Two of my colleagues at IBM thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if we had an internal radio station?" I was one of the initial front-end developers to help prototype this idea, and later worked on a team of 5 to make it real. It quickly took on a life of its own, with IBMers hosting weekly radio shows and enthusiastic listeners tuning in. The platform became recognized by the larger organization and was used to broadcast an <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('interview with ethan marcotte'); return false;" href="https://twitter.com/jeffersonwlam/status/652556396601303041">interview with Ethan Marcotte</a>.

            <p>On Bluemix (now <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('ibm cloud'); return false;" href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/">IBM Cloud</a>), I worked closely with designers on a number of projects, including an attempt to re-architect Bluemix, a design experiment around hypothesis driven development, and pushing production code to Bluemix. I also worked with the <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('orion'); return false;" href="https://orionhub.org/mixloginstatic/landing.html?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Forionhub.org%2F&key=FORMOAuthUser">Orion</a> team to teach and facilitate design thinking, conduct user research, and write code to polish their end-to-end UX. 2015 to 2016</p>

            <p>I was deployed onto Elastic Storage (now <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('ibm spectrum scale'); return false;" href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/scale-out-file-and-object-storage">IBM Spectrum Scale</a>) as part of the front lines to revamp the product using design thinking methodologies. I conducted user research to identify holes in the user experience, built a microsite to share said research, and also worked closely with designers to build prototypes for testing out ideas. 2014 to 2015. </p>
