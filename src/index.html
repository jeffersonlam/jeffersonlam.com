            <p>As the representative of both design and code, I took charge of the UX.</p>
            <p>My first task major task was to do user research to gain a strong understanding of the user's pain
              points. I took videos of players playing and also conducted user tests, asking them their thoughts as
              they played the game. This research was essential not only in the beginning but also throughout the
              process as a barometer of how our designs were working or not working.</p>
            <p>There were several angles to tackle this project from: as product design, and as game design.
              <p>From a product design perspective, we had two users: players (or students) and hosts (or teachers).
                For players, how do they join a game? How do they learn to play? For hosts, how do they set up and host
                a game? How do they control a game during play? These problems required work that had little overlap
                between the two users.</p>
              <p>It's one thing to create a product that solves a user's needs, but it's another thing to make a game:
                it needs to be fun to play. That meant thinking about the game rules, win and loss conditions, the game
                loop, and everything in between.</p>
              <p>With all this in mind, I jumped into the front-end code to implement changes. These included ensuring
                visual consistency throughout the app, making features obvious and usable at a glance, and simplifying
                complicated processes. I also created a whole host-facing portal so that hosts could make, start, and
                share their own games. We also tweaked the game rules endlessly to see how they would affect the game
                flow. Google Analytics was very helpful to see exactly which features were used and which weren't.</p>
              <p>On top of all the design and code, we also strived to create a sustainable business model so that we
                could work on this full time. Ultimately we discovered that there's not much profit to be made in the
                public education sector.</p>

            <p>On my first Whole30, I often spent lots of time googling
              additives in grocery
              store aisles. Frustrated by this tedious and repetitive task and surprised there wasn't an app for this, I decided to build one.</p>
            <p>I gathered all the info I could find from the book, online resources, and forums, and put it into a
              CSV file. I then converted the CSV file into a JSON object (I built a separate
              <a class="anchor" href="http://jefferson.im/csvtojson/" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://jefferson.im/csvtojson/');">
                 tool
              </a>
              for that). Then I built a UI to search the JSON data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now whenever I'm looking at obscure ingredients on a label, I can quickly pull this up and see if it's compliant just by typing in a few characters. If it's something new, I add it into the CSV file.
